<h2>Scenario 1</h2>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk">Book Depository</a> is an online bookstore that provides free
	shipping to many countries round the world. This gives it a slight edge over the popular online bookstore Amazon.
</p>
<p>
	Imagine you are interested in up and coming mathematics books, but, unfortunately, Book Depository does not provide
	an active feed of such data as it is keyed into its database.
</p>
<p>
	Use the system to create an extractor that provides a feed that would supply the needed information by extracting the relevant data
	from the e-bookstore. The feed must provide the data in order of latest to oldest.

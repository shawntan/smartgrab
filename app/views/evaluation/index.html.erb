<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	My system aims to help users extract information from webpages by specifying the content to be extracted visually,
	and places the extracted information in a convenient RSS feed. This tutorial hopes to instruct you on using the system,
	from how to sign up for an account to extracting data from a Google search result.
</p>

<ol>
	<h3>Installation instructions</h3>
	<li>
		<h4>Sign up for an account</h4>
		<p>Sign up for an account <a href="signup" target="new">here</a>. Don't worry, all the links on this page opens in a new window.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Drag the bookmarklet to the toolbar</h4>
		<img src="images/bookmarklet.png" align="left" style="-moz-box-shadow: 3px 3px 4px #CCCCCC;margin: 15px" />
		<p>Go <a href="bookmarklet">here</a> to get the bookmarklet. Simply drag the "Parcelize" to your toolbar.</p>
	</li>
	<h3>Usage Instructions</h3>
	<p>			Now that you have installed the bookmarklet, you can extract content from virtually any webpage.
			In order to use the system, click on the bookmarklet at any page.</p>
	<li>
		<h4>Navigate to page for extraction</h4>
		<p>

			In this example, let's use a Google search result. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Navigate to <a href="http://www.google.com" target="tutorial">Google</a> and enter any search query you like.
		</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h4>Start selecting!</h4>
		<p>
			Click on the bookmarklet that you dragged to the toolbar in step 2. An alert should pop up telling you to login to the system first.
			Always remember: You have to be signed-in in order to use the system. If you're not logged in, click <a href="login">here</a>.
		</p>
		<img src="images/dialogue.png" align="right" style="-moz-box-shadow: 3px 3px 4px #CCCCCC;" />
		<p>
			<b>Click on the bookmarklet again.</b> A small dialogue box similar to the one on the right should appear at the top right hand corner of your window.
			You should now see a grey box appearing around elements on the page as you mouse over them. This is your selector.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Click on an entry of the search result.</b> Notice that the browser no longer follows the link through to the page. Instead, it is highlighted in green.
			<b>Click on another entry</b>, and you will find that all the entries on the page are highlighted in yellow. The yellow elements represent elements that will be
			selected when the system is allowed to extract.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Finally, to save your selection, type in an appropriate name, say "Entries". Then click save.</b> Your selection will now be sent to the server to be saved.
			Once done, the entry will show up in the empty area on the dialogue box. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Extract data once for testing</h4>
		<img src="images/updatetime.png" align="left" style="-moz-box-shadow: 3px 3px 4px #CCCCCC;margin: 15px" />
		<p>
			Now that you've specified the content you want to extract from the page, the next step is to extract the data to see if the system does what you want.
			To do so, first navigate to your <a href="extractors">home page</a>.
			Here, you should see your first extractor entry. <b>Click "show" to see its details.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			At the extractor details page, you can set the time for daily extraction, as well as do a test extraction to see if data is extracted correctly.
			<b>Click "Extract now!" to try this.</b>
		</p>
	</li>	
	<li>
		<h4>Set time for regular extraction</h4>
		<p>
			Once you are satisfied with the data extracted, you can now set the time for daily extraction from the page.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Enjoy.</h4>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Now that you have familiarised yourself with the basic usage of the system, we can move on to our first scenario.
	You will be given a task and, using the system, carry out the given task.
	You will then be asked to provide some feedback regarding the system, such as ease of use, accuracy of extracted data, etc.
